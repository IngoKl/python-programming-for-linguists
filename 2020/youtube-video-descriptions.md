## 03 - Python for (Corpus) Linguists (Live Recording)

Important Note: There is a newer version of this video/module available! Please consider watching the new (2022) video instead of this recording: https://youtu.be/DLyVL0mEISU

This is the recording of the workshop live session "Python for (Corpus) Linguists". During the stream, I live coded exercises 8 to 16. The recording has been slightly shortened, and I have also added some explanatory slides. Given that this is a recording of a live session, it is not as polished as a screencast, and you can also watch me making mistakes along the way! :)

The finished and somewhat polished Python notebook (Google Colab), as well as the slides, are available in the repository.
