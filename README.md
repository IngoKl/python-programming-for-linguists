The **live session** (about three hours) will take place on **June 11th, 2021** at **18:00 CEST** on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ingokl).

**Quick Start**: Go straight to the [default learning path](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2021/learning-path-beginner-long.md) (*Absolute Beginner (Long)*).

---

Welcome to this repository for the *Python Programming for Linguists* workshop.

In this workshop, consisting of several videos and exercises, as well as a live session, you will be introduced to Python and its application within (corpus) linguistics. After a short general introduction to programming as well as Python, we will utilize Python to solve several (corpus) linguistic exercises.

This workshop is specifically targeted towards people who have **no prior experience programming**. While this workshop is not intended to make you a programmer, you will gain a fundamental understanding of how programming works and how to proceed should you want to deepen your knowledge and skills. In addition, by looking at various example tasks that are commonly solved using existing software, we will try to deepen our understanding of how commonly used tools work under the hood.

Please **be aware** that this workshop was specifically designed as **a first introduction to programming for non-coders and linguists** and not as a fully-fledged Python course. Therefore, we will take some shortcuts, disobey some best practices, and hide away quite a few of the underlying complexities. If you are interested in a more thorough introduction or want to deepen your already existing knowledge, please refer to the final video in which I present many great resources. Also, feel free to have a look at the [List of Additional Resources](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/Links_to_Resources.md).

While the materials and exercises are targeted towards beginners, they are **challenging**, and this workshop is designed as an **intense deep dive**!

Please do not feel discouraged if you get stuck or if something seems too hard at first. I have provided solutions for all exercises, and you will also find lots of additional helpful resources in this repository. Also, while not required, you can prepare for this workshop by consulting other slower-paced introductory courses such as the ones listed in [this document](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/Links_to_Resources.md). *You will get there!* ðŸš€

This (2021) is the second iteration of this workshop which started as part of my *Data Literacy for Linguists* class taught at the University of Cologne. Therefore, I will be reusing most of the material from the 2020 rendition. Please do not get confused about the `2020` and `2021` folders and simply follow the **learning path(s) provided below**. That being said, feel free to explore as much as you want!

Originally, this workshop has been inspired by workshops I held at [35c3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Session:(Python)_Programming_for_Absolute_Beginners) and [36c3 a](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Session:Python_Programming_for_Absolute_Beginners)/[36c3 b](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Session:Introduction_to_Natural_Language_Processing).

## 1. Learning Objectives

After completing this workshop, you will be able to ...

* describe what programming essentially is about.
* name and describe some basic programming terminology.
* model simple problems in terms of data structures and basic algorithms.
* write basic scripts in Python in order to solve specific problems.
* utilize third-party libraries such as [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org), [spaCy](https://spacy.io), and [TextDirectory](https://github.com/IngoKl/textdirectory).
* construct and apply basic regular expressions.
* utilize Python for text manipulation.
* utilize Python to perform concordance and frequency analysis.
* automatically annotate texts (PoS, Universal Dependencies, NER) using spaCy.
* scrape web data in order to build corpora (Web as Corpus) using Python.
* compute basic statistics using Python.

## 2. Workshop Outline & Learning Paths

This workshop is designed as a blend of **asynchronous and synchronous elements**. However, as everything will be recorded, you can also do this in a completely self-paced fashion.

The general idea is that you watch a series of videos and complete/attempt a series of exercises before joining the synchronous live session hosted on *Twitch*. During this live session, I will be solving [Exercises 8 to 17](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2021/exercises/Exercises%208-17.pdf) while you are invited to code along and to ask questions.

### 2.1 Learning Paths

To make things as straightforward as possible, I have created three learning paths for you to follow.

The *Absolute Beginner (Long)* path also contains additional materials and exercises. If you are already somewhat familiar with Python, you can have a look at the *Experienced in Python* path.

* [Absolute Beginner (Long)](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2021/learning-path-beginner-long.md)
* [Absolute Beginner (Short)](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2021/learning-path-beginner-short.md)
* [Experienced in Python](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2021/learning-path-experienced.md)

### 2.2 Live Session

The live session (about three hours) will take place on **June 11th, 2021** at **18:00 CEST** on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ingokl).

After the session, I will make available a recording. If you are interested, last year's recording (slightly edited and polished) is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70g9oeclNac).

## 3. Coding Along

I want to strongly encourage you to code along and to experiment with the exercises. The easiest way of doing this is to use *Google Colab*. In order to do this, you will need a Google Account. If you have never used *Colab* you might want to have a look at [this tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxjUEvQSFkU&list=PLG6oHk0SZfBwNq7gpK45e3YPTbfNfmKfi&index=1).

If you do not want to rely on Google, you can also set up your own local development environment. For a tutorial on how to do this on Windows, have a look at the video ["Setting Up Your Development Environment (Windows)."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrXEouns3fg)

The videos are intended to be paused from time to time. Do not feel forced to watch through a whole video before playing with the code ðŸ˜€.

## 4. List of Materials

## 5. Python Version and Coding Style

This workshop is based on **modern Python** and requires a version of Python >= 3.6. All of the code, as well as the used external libraries, should be compatible with everything up to Python 3.9 as well. If you are interested, also have a look at the [*Coding Style Guide*](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/tree/main/Coding_Style_Guide.md) for this workshop in which I discuss how most of the code is styled and why.
