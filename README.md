Welcome to this repository for the "Python Programming for Linguists" workshop.

In this workshop, consisting of five videos, several exercises, and a live session, you will be introduced to Python. After a short general introduction to programming as well as Python, we will utilize Python to solve several (corpus) linguistic exercises.

This workshop is specifically targeted towards people who have **no prior experience programming**. While this workshop is not intended to make you a programmer, you will gain a fundamental understanding of how programming works and how to proceed should you want to deepen your knowledge and skills. Also, by looking at various example tasks that are commonly solved using existing software, we will try deepen our understanding of how commonly used tools work under the hood.

Please **be aware** that this workshop was specifically designed as **a first introduction to programming for non-coders and linguists** and not as a fully-fledged Python course. Therefore, we will take some shortcuts, disobey some best practices, and hide away quite a few of the underlying complexities. If you are interested in a more thorough introduction or want to deepen your already existing knowledge, please refer to the final video in which I present many great resources.

This workshop is inspired by workshops I held at [35c3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Session:(Python)_Programming_for_Absolute_Beginners) and [36c3 a](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Session:Python_Programming_for_Absolute_Beginners)/[36c3 b](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Session:Introduction_to_Natural_Language_Processing).

## Learning Objectives

After completing this workshop, you will be able to ...

* describe what programming essentially is about.
* name and describe some basic programming terminology.
* model simple problems in terms of data structures and basic algorithms.
* write basic scripts in Python in order to solve specific problems.
* utilize third-party libraries such as [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org), [spaCy](https://spacy.io), and [TextDirectory](https://github.com/IngoKl/textdirectory).
* construct and apply basic regular expressions.
* utilize Python for text manipulation.
* utilize Python to perform concordance and frequency analysis.
* automatically annotate texts (PoS, Universal Dependencies, NER) using spaCy.
* scrape web data in order to build corpora (Web as Corpus) using Python.
* compute basic statistics using Python.

## Workshop Outline

Of course, you can use the materials here as you see fit. However, ideally, you take this workshop in the following order:

1. Watch the video ["Python Programming for Absolute Beginners"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UnF45lniyY).
2. Familiarize yourself with Python notebooks and try to solve [exercises 1 to 3](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2020/exercises/Exercises%201-3.pdf) ([Solutions](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2020/exercises/Solutions_Exercises_1_3.ipynb)).
3. Watch the video ["The Pizza Problem"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9tOyVI5B3E).
4. Try to solve [exercises 4 and 5](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2020/exercises/Exercises%204-5.pdf) ([Solutions](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2020/exercises/Solutions_Exercises_4_5.ipynb)).
5. Watch the video ["Working with Files, Texts, and Regular Expressions"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y37_JvSY-GM).
6. Try to solve [exercises 6 and 7](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2020/exercises/Exercises%206-7.pdf) ([Solutions](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2020/exercises/Solutions_Exercises_6_7.ipynb))
7. Think about [exercises 8 to 16]((https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2020/exercises/Exercises%208-16.pdf)) and do some research on how you could approach these problems.
8. Attend the live session or watch the recording - Python for (Corpus) Linguists + Exercises 8 to 16.
9. Watch the video ["Summary and Resources"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajKqESDmrKc).

Please note that for each exercise, you will find **solutions in this repository**. Don't feel bad if you cannot immediately solve the exercises - the solutions are there to help you. Of course, feel free to take apart these suggested solutions and play with them.

## Coding Along

I want to strongly encourage you to code along and to experiment with the exercises. The easiest way of doing this is to use *Google Colab* (see above). In order to do this, you will need a Google Account.

If you do not want to rely on Google, you can also set up your own local development environment. For a tutorial on how to do this on Windows, have a look at the video ["Setting Up Your Development Environment (Windows)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrXEouns3fg).

The videos are intended to be paused from time to time. Do not feel forced to watch through a whole video before playing with the code :).

## Live Session

The live session will take place on **January 15th, 2021** at **18:00 CET** on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ingokl).
