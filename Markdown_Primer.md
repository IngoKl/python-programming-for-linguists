# Markdown Primer

Markdown is a simple [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) used for creating formatted text.
For the purpose of this workshop, Markdown is interesting because it can be used to format cells in *Colab* or *Jupyter* notebooks. 
*GitHub* is also rendering Markdown files (usually the extension is `.md`).

Maybe you have noticed that this file itself is formatted using Markdown. If you're interested, have a look at the [raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/main/Markdown_Primer.md) to see the underlying Markdown code.

## Formatting Text

Here are a few example for you to try:

`*Text*`

*Text*

`**Text**`

**Text**

`~Text~`

~Text~

```
* A
* B
* C
```

* A
* B
* C
