# Learning Path - Experienced in Python

Welcome to the *Experienced in Python* learning path. This is the shortest learning path and will skip over most introductory material. This document, compared to the beginner's version, is also very matter-of-fact. If you are looking for a little bit more handholding, have a look at the other learning paths. ðŸ˜Š

Before you proceed, please make sure that you have read the introductory [README.md](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/README.md) file outlining this course.

Since you already have some experience with Python, I assume that you are able to run *Jupyter Notebooks* either locally or in the cloud (e.g., *Google Colab*).

## Let's Get Coding

Having previous Python knowledge will allow you to skip the first few videos and exercises.

If you are unfamiliar with *Regular Expressions*, now would be a great time to have a look at the [*RegEx Primer for Linguistics*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7-QkwOU9RY). After watching the video, you should be prepared to take a shot at the [Additional Exercises on Regular Expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGEveroG3Fgs).

1. Watch the video ["Working with Files, Texts, and Regular Expressions"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y37_JvSY-GM).
2. Try to solve [exercises 6 and 7](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2020/exercises/Exercises%206-7.pdf) ([Solutions](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2020/exercises/Solutions_Exercises_6_7.ipynb)).

Now we are approaching the biggest set of exercises in this workshop. These exercises (Exercises 8 to 17) are very challenging and will be solved during the live session. Of course, you can also go through them by watching the recording. In these exercises, we will recreate some common tools used in corpus linguistics as well as work with some real-life data.

If you have knowledge about intermediate Python concepts (e.g., List Comprehensions and Pandas `DataFrames`) you can safely skip to the Exercises. If not, have a look at the [*New Tools and Syntax*](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2021/notebooks/03_New_Tools_and_Syntax.ipynb) notebook and play around with these new tools in your toolbox.

Now you should be ready for [*Exercises 8 to 17*](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2021/exercises/Exercises%208-17.pdf). Have a look at them, but don't get scared! ðŸ˜± These are rather challenging, and you are not supposed to solve them on your own just now! That said, especially if you are planning to attend the live session, having a look at them beforehand will help during the session.

If you are working through the workshop at your own pace, have a look at the recording of the live session and work through the exercises.

*Congratulations, you are almost finished!* ðŸ˜ƒ

3. Finally, watch the video ["Summary and Resources"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajKqESDmrKc).

Now that you have worked through most of the materials feel free to have a look at the [Bonus Notebooks](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/tree/main/Bonus%20Notebooks) and the [List of Additional Resources](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/Links_to_Resources.md).
