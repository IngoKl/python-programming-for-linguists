# Learning Path - Absolute Beginner (Long)

Welcome to the *Absolute Beginner (Long)* learning path. This is also the *default path* for this workshop.

Before you proceed, pleas make sure that you have read the introductory [README.md](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/README.md) file outlining this course. If you are eager, this would also be a great opportunity to have a look at the [*Markdown Primer*](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/Markdown_Primer.md) to learn something about Markdown.

## First Steps

Before starting the actual workshop, you will have to make a decision. You can either use *Google Colab*, a browser-based development environment, or your own computer for coding along. While the first option is a lot easier, more comfortable, and recommended, you will be required to have or create a Google account.

If you are willing to use or create a Google account, proceed as follows:

1. Watch the video ["Python Programming for Absolute Beginners"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UnF45lniyY)
2. Watch the video ["Getting Started with Google Colab"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxjUEvQSFkU)

You can also flip these two videos around if you are eager to start coding!

If you don't want to rely on Google, you will have to set up your own development environment locally. In this case, proceed as follows:

1. Watch the video ["Python Programming for Absolute Beginners"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UnF45lniyY)
2. Watch the video [Setting Up Your Development Environment (Windows)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrXEouns3fg)

## Let's Get Coding

You now should have a first understanding of the Python programming language as well as an environment in which you can code. *Awesome!*

Now you will go trough a series of videos and exercises. These will teach your Python and also prepare you for the live session (and/or the recording of it).

3. Familiarize yourself with Python notebooks and try to solve [exercises 1 to 3](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2020/exercises/Exercises%201-3.pdf) ([Solutions](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2020/exercises/Solutions_Exercises_1_3.ipynb))
4. Watch the video ["The Pizza Problem"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9tOyVI5B3E)
5. Try to solve [exercises 4 and 5](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2020/exercises/Exercises%204-5.pdf) ([Solutions](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2020/exercises/Solutions_Exercises_4_5.ipynb)).

If you are unfamiliar with *Regular Expressions*, now would be a great time to have a look at the [*RegEx Primer Linguistics*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7-QkwOU9RY). You should now also be prepared to take a shot at the [Additional Exercises on Regular Expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGEveroG3Fgs).

Let's get back to the regular program:

6. Watch the video ["Working with Files, Texts, and Regular Expressions"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y37_JvSY-GM)
7. Try to solve [exercises 6 and 7](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2020/exercises/Exercises%206-7.pdf) ([Solutions](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2020/exercises/Solutions_Exercises_6_7.ipynb))

Now we are approaching the biggest set of exercises in this workshop. These exercises (Exercises 8 to 17) are very challenging and will be solved during the livestream. Of course, you can also go through them by watching the recording.

Either way, you should prepare a little before attempting them:

8. Have a look at the [*(Linux) Command Line Primer*](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/Command_Line_Primer.md)
9. Have a look at the [*New Tools and Syntax*](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2021/notebooks/03_New_Tools_and_Syntax.ipynb) notebook and play around with these new tools in your toolbox.

Now you should be ready for [*Exercises 8 to 17*](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/2021/exercises/Exercises%208-17.pdf). Have a look at them, but don't get scared. These are rather challenging and you are not supposed to solve them on your own just now. That said, especially if you are planning to attend the live session, having a look at them beforehand will help during the session.

If you are working through the workshop on your own pace, have a look at the recording of the live session and work through the exercises.

*Congratulations, you are almost finished!*

10. Watch the video ["Summary and Resources"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajKqESDmrKc)

Now that you have worked through most of the materials, feel free to have a look at the [Bonus Notebooks](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/tree/main/Bonus%20Notebooks) and the [List of Additional Resources](https://github.com/IngoKl/python-programming-for-linguists/blob/main/Links_to_Resources.md)
