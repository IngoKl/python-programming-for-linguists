              "  'text': ' the man with the twisted lip arthur conan doyle isa whitney, brother of the late elias whitney, d.d., principal of the theological college of st. george\\'s, was much addicted to opium. the habit grew upon him, as i understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read de quincey\\'s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. he found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. i can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man. one night--it was in june, \\'89--there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. i sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment. \"a patient!\" said she. \"you\\'ll have to go out.\" i groaned, for i was newly come back from a weary day. we heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room. \"you will excuse my calling so late,\" she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife\\'s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. \"oh, i\\'m in such trouble!\" she cried; \"i do so want a little help.\" \"why,\" said my wife, pulling up her veil, \"it is kate whitney. how you startled me, kate! i had not an idea who you were when you came in.\" \"i didn\\'t know what to do, so i came straight to you.\" that was always the way. folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house. \"it was very sweet of you to come. now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. or should you rather that i sent james off to bed?\" \"oh, no, no! i want the doctor\\'s advice and help, too. it\\'s about isa. he has not been home for two days. i am so frightened about him!\" it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband\\'s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school companion. we soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. did she know where her husband was? was it possible that we could bring him back to her? it seems that it was. she had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the city. hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. but now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. there he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the bar of gold, in upper swandam lane. but what was she to do? how could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him? there was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. might i not escort her to this place? and then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? i was isa whitney\\'s medical adviser, and as such i had influence over him. i could manage it better if i were alone. i promised her on my word that i would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. and so in ten minutes i had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be. but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of london bridge. between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, i found the den of which i was in search. ordering my cab to wait, i passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door i found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship. through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. the most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. at the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire. as i entered, a sallow malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth. \"thank you. i have not come to stay,\" said i. \"there is a friend of mine here, mr. isa whitney, and i wish to speak with him.\" there was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, i saw whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me. \"my god! it\\'s watson,\" said he. he was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. \"i say, watson, what o\\'clock is it?\" \"nearly eleven.\" \"of what day?\" \"of friday, june 19th.\" \"good heavens! i thought it was wednesday. it is wednesday. what d\\'you want to frighten a chap for?\" he sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key. \"i tell you that it is friday, man. your wife has been waiting this two days for you. you should be ashamed of yourself!\" \"so i am. but you\\'ve got mixed, watson, for i have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--i forget how many. but i\\'ll go home with you. i wouldn\\'t frighten kate--poor little kate. give me your hand! have you a cab?\" \"yes, i have one waiting.\" \"then i shall go in it. but i must owe something. find what i owe, watson. i am all off colour. i can do nothing for myself.\" i walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. as i passed the tall man who sat by the brazier i felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, \"walk past me, and then look back at me.\" the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. i glanced down. they could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. i took two steps forward and looked back. it took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. he had turned his back so that none could see him but i. his form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than sherlock holmes. he made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility. \"holmes!\" i whispered, \"what on earth are you doing in this den?\" \"as low as you can,\" he answered; \"i have excellent ears. if you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours i should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.\" \"i have a cab outside.\" \"then pray send him home in it. you may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. i should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me. if you will wait outside, i shall be with you in five minutes.\" it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes\\' requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. i felt, however, that when whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, i could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. in a few minutes i had written my note, paid whitney\\'s bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. in a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and i was walking down the street with sherlock holmes. for two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter. \"i suppose, watson,\" said he, \"that you imagine that i have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.\" \"i was certainly surprised to find you there.\" \"but not more so than i to find you.\" \"i came to find a friend.\" \"and i to find an enemy.\" \"an enemy?\" \"yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall i say, my natural prey. briefly, watson, i am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and i have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as i have done before now. had i been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour\\'s purchase; for i have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. there is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of paul\\'s wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.\" \"what! you do not mean bodies?\" \"ay, bodies, watson. we should be rich men if we had £1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. it is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and i fear that neville st. clair has entered it never to leave it more. but our trap should be here.\" he put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses\\' hoofs. \"now, watson,\" said holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. \"you\\'ll come with me, won\\'t you?\" \"if i can be of use.\" \"oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. my room at the cedars is a double-bedded one.\" \"the cedars?\" \"yes; that is mr. st. clair\\'s house. i am staying there while i conduct the inquiry.\" \"where is it, then?\" \"near lee, in kent. we have a seven-mile drive before us.\" \"but i am all in the dark.\" \"of course you are. you\\'ll know all about it presently. jump up here. all right, john; we shall not need you. here\\'s half a crown. look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. give her her head. so long, then!\" he flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds. holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while i sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. we had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best. \"you have a grand gift of silence, watson,\" said he. \"it makes you quite invaluable as a companion. \\'pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. i was wondering what i should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door.\" \"you forget that i know nothing about it.\" \"i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to lee. it seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow i can get nothing to go upon. there\\'s plenty of thread, no doubt, but i can\\'t get the end of it into my hand. now, i\\'ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.\" \"proceed, then.\" \"some years ago--to be definite, in may, 1884--there came to lee a gentleman, neville st. clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. he took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived generally in good style. by degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. he had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5.14 from cannon street every night. mr. st. clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know him. i may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £88 10s., while he has £220 standing to his credit in the capital and counties bank. there is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind. \"last monday mr. neville st. clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks. now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the aberdeen shipping company. now, if you are well up in your london, you will know that the office of the company is in fresno street, which branches out of upper swandam lane, where you found me to-night. mrs. st. clair had her lunch, started for the city, did some shopping, proceeded to the company\\'s office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4.35 walking through swandam lane on her way back to the station. have you followed me so far?\" \"it is very clear.\" \"if you remember, monday was an exceedingly hot day, and mrs. st. clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. while she was walking in this way down swandam lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. the window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. he waved his hands frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie. \"convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night--and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. at the foot of the stairs, however, she met this lascar scoundrel of whom i have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in fresno street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. the inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to the room in which mr. st. clair had last been seen. there was no sign of him there. in fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. both he and the lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. so determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that mrs. st. clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. out there fell a cascade of children\\'s bricks. it was the toy which he had promised to bring home. \"this discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. the rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. the front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. the bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. on examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of mr. neville st. clair, with the exception of his coat. his boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were there. there were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of mr. neville st. clair. out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy. \"and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by mrs. st. clair\\'s story, he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband\\'s appearance at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. his defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman\\'s clothes. \"so much for the lascar manager. now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st. clair. his name is hugh boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city. he is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. some little distance down threadneedle street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. i have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of making his professional acquaintance, and i have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. his appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. a shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest.\" \"but a cripple!\" said i. \"what could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?\" \"he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. surely your medical experience would tell you, watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.\" \"pray continue your narrative.\" \"mrs. st. clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. inspector barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. one mistake had been made in not arresting boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could incriminate him. there were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. he denied strenuously having ever seen mr. neville st. clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. as to mrs. st. clair\\'s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming. he was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue. \"and it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. it was neville st. clair\\'s coat, and not neville st. clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. and what do you think they found in the pockets?\" \"i cannot imagine.\" \"no, i don\\'t think you would guess. every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. it was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. but a human body is a different matter. there is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house. it seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.\" \"but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. would the body be dressed in a coat alone?\" \"no, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. suppose that this man boone had thrust neville st. clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. what would he do then? it would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. he would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. he has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. there is not an instant to be lost. he rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat\\'s sinking. he throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.\" \"it certainly sounds feasible.\" \"well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. boone, as i have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. he had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. there the matter stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved--what neville st. clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearance--are all as far from a solution as ever. i confess that i cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.\" while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows. \"we are on the outskirts of lee,\" said my companion. \"we have touched on three english counties in our short drive, starting in middlesex, passing over an angle of surrey, and ending in kent. see that light among the trees? that is the cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, i have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse\\'s feet.\" \"but why are you not conducting the case from baker street?\" i asked. \"because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. mrs. st. clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague. i hate to meet her, watson, when i have no news of her husband. here we are. whoa, there, whoa!\" we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. a stable-boy had run out to the horse\\'s head, and springing down, i followed holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. as we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. she stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question. \"well?\" she cried, \"well?\" and then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders. \"no good news?\" \"none.\" \"no bad?\" \"no.\" \"thank god for that. but come in. you must be weary, for you have had a long day.\" \"this is my friend, dr. watson. he has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation.\" \"i am delighted to see you,\" said she, pressing my hand warmly. \"you will, i am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us.\" \"my dear madam,\" said i, \"i am an old campaigner, and if i were not i can very well see that no apology is needed. if i can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, i shall be indeed happy.\" \"now, mr. sherlock holmes,\" said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out, \"i should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to which i beg that you will give a plain answer.\" \"certainly, madam.\" \"do not trouble about my feelings. i am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. i simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.\" \"upon what point?\" \"in your heart of hearts, do you think that neville is alive?\" sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. \"frankly, now!\" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair. \"frankly, then, madam, i do not.\" \"you think that he is dead?\" \"i do.\" \"murdered?\" \"i don\\'t say that. perhaps.\" \"and on what day did he meet his death?\" \"on monday.\" \"then perhaps, mr. holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that i have received a letter from him to-day.\" sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised. \"what!\" he roared. \"yes, to-day.\" she stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air. \"may i see it?\" \"certainly.\" he snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. i had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. the envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight. \"coarse writing,\" murmured holmes. \"surely this is not your husband\\'s writing, madam.\" \"no, but the enclosure is.\" \"i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address.\" \"how can you tell that?\" \"the name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. the rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. if it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. this man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. it is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. let us now see the letter. ha! there has been an enclosure here!\" \"yes, there was a ring. his signet-ring.\" \"and you are sure that this is your husband\\'s hand?\" \"one of his hands.\" \"one?\" \"his hand when he wrote hurriedly. it is very unlike his usual writing, and yet i know it well.\" \"dearest do not be frightened. all will come well. there is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify. wait in patience. \"neville. written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. hum! posted to-day in gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. ha! and the flap has been gummed, if i am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. and you have no doubt that it is your husband\\'s hand, madam?\" \"none. neville wrote those words.\" \"and they were posted to-day at gravesend. well, mrs. st. clair, the clouds lighten, though i should not venture to say that the danger is over.\" \"but he must be alive, mr. holmes.\" \"unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. the ring, after all, proves nothing. it may have been taken from him.\" \"no, no; it is, it is his very own writing!\" \"very well. it may, however, have been written on monday and only posted to-day.\" \"that is possible.\" \"if so, much may have happened between.\" \"oh, you must not discourage me, mr. holmes. i know that all is well with him. there is so keen a sympathy between us that i should know if evil came upon him. on the very day that i saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet i in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened. do you think that i would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?\" \"i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view. but if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?\" \"i cannot imagine. it is unthinkable.\" \"and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you?\" \"no.\" \"and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane?\" \"very much so.\" \"was the window open?\" \"yes.\" \"then he might have called to you?\" \"he might.\" \"he only, as i understand, gave an inarticulate cry?\" \"yes.\" \"a call for help, you thought?\" \"yes. he waved his hands.\" \"but it might have been a cry of surprise. astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?\" \"it is possible.\" \"and you thought he was pulled back?\" \"he disappeared so suddenly.\" \"he might have leaped back. you did not see anyone else in the room?\" \"no, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs.\" \"quite so. your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?\" \"but without his collar or tie. i distinctly saw his bare throat.\" \"had he ever spoken of swandam lane?\" \"never.\" \"had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?\" \"never.\" \"thank you, mrs. st. clair. those are the principal points about which i wished to be absolutely clear. we shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.\" a large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and i was quickly between the sheets, for i was weary after my night of adventure. sherlock holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. it was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. he took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. with these he constructed a sort of eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. in the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. so he sat as i dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and i found the summer sun shining into the apartment. the pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which i had seen upon the previous night. \"awake, watson?\" he asked. \"yes.\" \"game for a morning drive?\" \"certainly.\" \"then dress. no one is stirring yet, but i know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.\" he chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night. as i dressed i glanced at my watch. it was no wonder that no one was stirring. it was twenty-five minutes past four. i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse. \"i want to test a little theory of mine,\" said he, pulling on his boots. \"i think, watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe. i deserve to be kicked from here to charing cross. but i think i have the key of the affair now.\" \"and where is it?\" i asked, smiling. \"in the bathroom,\" he answered. \"oh, yes, i am not joking,\" he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. \"i have just been there, and i have taken it out, and i have got it in this gladstone bag. come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.\" we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. in the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. we both sprang in, and away we dashed down the london road. a few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream. \"it has been in some points a singular case,\" said holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. \"i confess that i have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.\" in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey side. passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the river, and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in bow street. sherlock holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. one of them held the horse\\'s head while the other led us in. \"who is on duty?\" asked holmes. \"inspector bradstreet, sir.\" \"ah, bradstreet, how are you?\" a tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. \"i wish to have a quiet word with you, bradstreet.\" \"certainly, mr. holmes. step into my room here.\" it was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. the inspector sat down at his desk. \"what can i do for you, mr. holmes?\" \"i called about that beggarman, boone--the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of mr. neville st. clair, of lee.\" \"yes. he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.\" \"so i heard. you have him here?\" \"in the cells.\" \"is he quiet?\" \"oh, he gives no trouble. but he is a dirty scoundrel.\" \"dirty?\" \"yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker\\'s. well, when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and i think, if you saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it.\" \"i should like to see him very much.\" \"would you? that is easily done. come this way. you can leave your bag.\" \"no, i think that i\\'ll take it.\" \"very good. come this way, if you please.\" he led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side. \"the third on the right is his,\" said the inspector. \"here it is!\" he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through. \"he is asleep,\" said he. \"you can see him very well.\" we both put our eyes to the grating. the prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. he was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. he was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. a broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. a shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead. \"he\\'s a beauty, isn\\'t he?\" said the inspector. \"he certainly needs a wash,\" remarked holmes. \"i had an idea that he might, and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.\" he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge. \"he! he! you are a funny one,\" chuckled the inspector. \"now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.\" \"well, i don\\'t know why not,\" said the inspector. \"he doesn\\'t look a credit to the bow street cells, does he?\" he slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. the sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner\\'s face. \"let me introduce you,\" he shouted, \"to mr. neville st. clair, of lee, in the county of kent.\" never in my life have i seen such a sight. the man\\'s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. gone was the coarse brown tint! gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! a twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow. \"great heavens!\" cried the inspector, \"it is, indeed, the missing man. i know him from the photograph.\" the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. \"be it so,\" said he. \"and pray what am i charged with?\" \"with making away with mr. neville st.--oh, come, you can\\'t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,\" said the inspector with a grin. \"well, i have been twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.\" \"if i am mr. neville st. clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore, i am illegally detained.\" \"no crime, but a very great error has been committed,\" said holmes. \"you would have done better to have trusted your wife.\" \"it was not the wife; it was the children,\" groaned the prisoner. \"god help me, i would not have them ashamed of their father. my god! what an exposure! what can i do?\" sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder. \"if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,\" said he, \"of course you can hardly avoid publicity. on the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, i do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. inspector bradstreet would, i am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. the case would then never go into court at all.\" \"god bless you!\" cried the prisoner passionately. \"i would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children. \"you are the first who have ever heard my story. my father was a schoolmaster in chesterfield, where i received an excellent education. i travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in london. one day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and i volunteered to supply them. there was the point from which all my adventures started. it was only by trying begging as an amateur that i could get the facts upon which to base my articles. when an actor i had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. i took advantage now of my attainments. i painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, i took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. for seven hours i plied my trade, and when i returned home in the evening i found to my surprise that i had received no less than 26s. 4d. \"i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for £25. i was at my wit\\'s end where to get the money, but a sudden idea came to me. i begged a fortnight\\'s grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise. in ten days i had the money and had paid the debt. \"well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at £2 a week when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and sitting still. it was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and i threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. only one man knew my secret. he was the keeper of a low den in which i used to lodge in swandam lane, where i could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. this fellow, a lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that i knew that my secret was safe in his possession. \"well, very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of money. i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london could earn £700 a year--which is less than my average takings--but i had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city. all day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take £2. \"as i grew richer i grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. my dear wife knew that i had business in the city. she little knew what. \"last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. i gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. i heard her voice downstairs, but i knew that she could not ascend. swiftly i threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. even a wife\\'s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. but then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. i threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. then i seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which i had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which i carried my takings. i hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the thames. the other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after i found, rather, i confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as mr. neville st. clair, i was arrested as his murderer. \"i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. i was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, i slipped off my ring and confided it to the lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.\" \"that note only reached her yesterday,\" said holmes. \"good god! what a week she must have spent!\" \"the police have watched this lascar,\" said inspector bradstreet, \"and i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days.\" \"that was it,\" said holmes, nodding approvingly; \"i have no doubt of it. but have you never been prosecuted for begging?\" \"many times; but what was a fine to me?\" \"it must stop here, however,\" said bradstreet. \"if the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of hugh boone.\" \"i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.\" \"in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. but if you are found again, then all must come out. i am sure, mr. holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. i wish i knew how you reach your results.\" \"i reached this one,\" said my friend, \"by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. i think, watson, that if we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast.\" ---------- this

              "  'text': ' the red-headed league arthur conan doyle i had called upon my friend, mr. sherlock holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. with an apology for my intrusion, i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me. \"you could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear watson,\" he said cordially. \"i was afraid that you were engaged.\" \"so i am. very much so.\" \"then i can wait in the next room.\" \"not at all. this gentleman, mr. wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.\" the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes. \"try the settee,\" said holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. \"i know, my dear watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.\" \"your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\" i observed. \"you will remember that i remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.\" \"a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting.\" \"you did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. now, mr. jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time. you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to. perhaps, mr. wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. i ask you not merely because my friend dr. watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. as a rule, when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events, i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\" the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. as he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, i took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance. i did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. he wore rather baggy grey shepherd\\'s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. a frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. altogether, look as i would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features. sherlock holmes\\' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. \"beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a freemason, that he has been in china, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, i can deduce nothing else.\" mr. jabez wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion. \"how, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, mr. holmes?\" he asked. \"how did you know, for example, that i did manual labour. it\\'s as true as gospel, for i began as a ship\\'s carpenter.\" \"your hands, my dear sir. your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. you have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.\" \"well, the snuff, then, and the freemasonry?\" \"i won\\'t insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.\" \"ah, of course, i forgot that. but the writing?\" \"what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?\" \"well, but china?\" \"the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china. i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. that trick of staining the fishes\\' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china. when, in addition, i see a chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.\" mr. jabez wilson laughed heavily. \"well, i never!\" said he. \"i thought at first that you had done something clever, but i see that there was nothing in it, after all.\" \"i begin to think, watson,\" said holmes, \"that i make a mistake in explaining. \\'omne ignotum pro magnifico,\\' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid. can you not find the advertisement, mr. wilson?\" \"yes, i have got it now,\" he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. \"here it is. this is what began it all. you just read it for yourself, sir.\" i took the paper from him and read as follows: \"to the red-headed league: on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins, of lebanon, pennsylvania, u. s. a., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of £4 a week for purely nominal services. all red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. apply in person on monday, at eleven o\\'clock, to duncan ross, at the offices of the league, 7 pope\\'s court, fleet street.\" \"what on earth does this mean?\" i ejaculated after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcement. holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. \"it is a little off the beaten track, isn\\'t it?\" said he. \"and now, mr. wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. you will first make a note, doctor, of the paper and the date.\" \"it is the morning chronicle of april 27, 1890. just two months ago.\" \"very good. now, mr. wilson?\" \"well, it is just as i have been telling you, mr. sherlock holmes,\" said jabez wilson, mopping his forehead; \"i have a small pawnbroker\\'s business at coburg square, near the city. it\\'s not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. i used to be able to keep two assistants, but now i only keep one; and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business.\" \"what is the name of this obliging youth?\" asked sherlock holmes. \"his name is vincent spaulding, and he\\'s not such a youth, either. it\\'s hard to say his age. i should not wish a smarter assistant, mr. holmes; and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him. but, after all, if he is satisfied, why should i put ideas in his head?\" \"why, indeed? you seem most fortunate in having an employee who comes under the full market price. it is not a common experience among employers in this age. i don\\'t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement.\" \"oh, he has his faults, too,\" said mr. wilson. \"never was such a fellow for photography. snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. that is his main fault, but on the whole he\\'s a good worker. there\\'s no vice in him.\" \"he is still with you, i presume?\" \"yes, sir. he and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--that\\'s all i have in the house, for i am a widower and never had any family. we live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more. \"the first thing that put us out was that advertisement. spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says: \"\\'i wish to the lord, mr. wilson, that i was a red-headed man.\\' \"\\'why that?\\' i asks. \"\\'why,\\' says he, \\'here\\'s another vacancy on the league of the red-headed men. it\\'s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits\\' end what to do with the money. if my hair would only change colour, here\\'s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.\\' \"\\'why, what is it, then?\\' i asked. you see, mr. holmes, i am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. in that way i didn\\'t know much of what was going on outside, and i was always glad of a bit of news. \"\\'have you never heard of the league of the red-headed men?\\' he asked with his eyes open. \"\\'never.\\' \"\\'why, i wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.\\' \"\\'and what are they worth?\\' i asked. \"\\'oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one\\'s other occupations.\\' \"well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy. \"\\'tell me all about it,\\' said i. \"\\'well,\\' said he, showing me the advertisement, \\'you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. as far as i can make out, the league was founded by an american millionaire, ezekiah hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. he was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.\\' \"\\'but,\\' said i, \\'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.\\' \"\\'not so many as you might think,\\' he answered. \\'you see it is really confined to londoners, and to grown men. this american had started from london when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. then, again, i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. now, if you cared to apply, mr. wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.\\' \"now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met. vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful, so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. he was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement. \"i never hope to see such a sight as that again, mr. holmes. from north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. fleet street was choked with red-headed folk, and pope\\'s court looked like a coster\\'s orange barrow. i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. when i saw how many were waiting, i would have given it up in despair; but spaulding would not hear of it. how he did it i could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. there was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.\" \"your experience has been a most entertaining one,\" remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. \"pray continue your very interesting statement.\" \"there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. he said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. however, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us. \"\\'this is mr. jabez wilson,\\' said my assistant, \\'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league.\\' \"\\'and he is admirably suited for it,\\' the other answered. \\'he has every requirement. i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine.\\' he took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful. then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success. \"\\'it would be injustice to hesitate,\\' said he. \\'you will, however, i am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.\\' with that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until i yelled with the pain. \\'there is water in your eyes,\\' said he as he released me. \\'i perceive that all is as it should be. but we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. i could tell you tales of cobbler\\'s wax which would disgust you with human nature.\\' he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. a groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager. \"\\'my name,\\' said he, \\'is mr. duncan ross, and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. are you a married man, mr. wilson? have you a family?\\' \"i answered that i had not. \"his face fell immediately. \"\\'dear me!\\' he said gravely, \\'that is very serious indeed! i am sorry to hear you say that. the fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.\\' \"my face lengthened at this, mr. holmes, for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right. \"\\'in the case of another,\\' said he, \\'the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?\\' \"\\'well, it is a little awkward, for i have a business already,\\' said i. \"\\'oh, never mind about that, mr. wilson!\\' said vincent spaulding. \\'i should be able to look after that for you.\\' \"\\'what would be the hours?\\' i asked. \"\\'ten to two.\\' \"now a pawnbroker\\'s business is mostly done of an evening, mr. holmes, especially thursday and friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. besides, i knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up. \"\\'that would suit me very well,\\' said i. \\'and the pay?\\' \"\\'is £4 a week.\\' \"\\'and the work?\\' \"\\'is purely nominal.\\' \"\\'what do you call purely nominal?\\' \"\\'well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. if you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. the will is very clear upon that point. you don\\'t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.\\' \"\\'it\\'s only four hours a day, and i should not think of leaving,\\' said i. \"\\'no excuse will avail,\\' said mr. duncan ross; \\'neither sickness nor business nor anything else. there you must stay, or you lose your billet.\\' \"\\'and the work?\\' \"\\'is to copy out the \"encyclopaedia britannica.\" there is the first volume of it in that press. you must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. will you be ready to-morrow?\\' \"\\'certainly,\\' i answered. \"\\'then, good-bye, mr. jabez wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.\\' he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, i was so pleased at my own good fortune. \"well, i thought over the matter all day, and by evening i was in low spirits again; for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be i could not imagine. it seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the \\'encyclopaedia britannica.\\' vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. however, in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow, so i bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, i started off for pope\\'s court. \"well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. the table was set out ready for me, and mr. duncan ross was there to see that i got fairly to work. he started me off upon the letter a, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. at two o\\'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that i had written, and locked the door of the office after me. \"this went on day after day, mr. holmes, and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week\\'s work. it was the same next week, and the same the week after. every morning i was there at ten, and every afternoon i left at two. by degrees mr. duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. still, of course, i never dared to leave the room for an instant, for i was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that i would not risk the loss of it. \"eight weeks passed away like this, and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica, and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the b\\'s before very long. it cost me something in foolscap, and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. and then suddenly the whole business came to an end.\" \"to an end?\" \"yes, sir. and no later than this morning. i went to my work as usual at ten o\\'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. here it is, and you can read for yourself.\" he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. it read in this fashion: the red-headed league is dissolved october 9, 1890. sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter. \"i cannot see that there is anything very funny,\" cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. \"if you can do nothing better than laugh at me, i can go elsewhere.\" \"no, no,\" cried holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. \"i really wouldn\\'t miss your case for the world. it is most refreshingly unusual. but there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?\" \"i was staggered, sir. i did not know what to do. then i called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. finally, i went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the red-headed league. he said that he had never heard of any such body. then i asked him who mr. duncan ross was. he answered that the name was new to him. \"\\'well,\\' said i, \\'the gentleman at no. 4.\\' \"\\'what, the red-headed man?\\' \"\\'yes.\\' \"\\'oh,\\' said he, \\'his name was william morris. he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. he moved out yesterday.\\' \"\\'where could i find him?\\' \"\\'oh, at his new offices. he did tell me the address. yes, 17 king edward street, near st. paul\\'s.\\' \"i started off, mr. holmes, but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either mr. william morris or mr. duncan ross.\" \"and what did you do then?\" asked holmes. \"i went home to saxe-coburg square, and i took the advice of my assistant. but he could not help me in any way. he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post. but that was not quite good enough, mr. holmes. i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, i came right away to you.\" \"and you did very wisely,\" said holmes. \"your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and i shall be happy to look into it. from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.\" \"grave enough!\" said mr. jabez wilson. \"why, i have lost four pound a week.\" \"as far as you are personally concerned,\" remarked holmes, \"i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. on the contrary, you are, as i understand, richer by some £30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a. you have lost nothing by them.\" \"no, sir. but i want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. it was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.\" \"we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. and, first, one or two questions, mr. wilson. this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you?\" \"about a month then.\" \"how did he come?\" \"in answer to an advertisement.\" \"was he the only applicant?\" \"no, i had a dozen.\" \"why did you pick him?\" \"because he was handy and would come cheap.\" \"at half-wages, in fact.\" \"yes.\" \"what is he like, this vincent spaulding?\" \"small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he\\'s not short of thirty. has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.\" holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. \"i thought as much,\" said he. \"have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?\" \"yes, sir. he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad.\" \"hum!\" said holmes, sinking back in deep thought. \"he is still with you?\" \"oh, yes, sir; i have only just left him.\" \"and has your business been attended to in your absence?\" \"nothing to complain of, sir. there\\'s never very much to do of a morning.\" \"that will do, mr. wilson. i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. to-day is saturday, and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion.\" \"well, watson,\" said holmes when our visitor had left us, \"what do you make of it all?\" \"i make nothing of it,\" i answered frankly. \"it is a most mysterious business.\" \"as a rule,\" said holmes, \"the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. it is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. but i must be prompt over this matter.\" \"what are you going to do, then?\" i asked. \"to smoke,\" he answered. \"it is quite a three pipe problem, and i beg that you won\\'t speak to me for fifty minutes.\" he curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece. \"sarasate plays at the st. james\\'s hall this afternoon,\" he remarked. \"what do you think, watson? could your patients spare you for a few hours?\" \"i have nothing to do to-day. my practice is never very absorbing.\" \"then put on your hat and come. i am going through the city first, and we can have some lunch on the way. i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than italian or french. it is introspective, and i want to introspect. come along!\" we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate; and a short walk took us to saxe-coburg square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. it was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. three gilt balls and a brown board with \"jabez wilson\" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. finally he returned to the pawnbroker\\'s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. it was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in. \"thank you,\" said holmes, \"i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand.\" \"third right, fourth left,\" answered the assistant promptly, closing the door. \"smart fellow, that,\" observed holmes as we walked away. \"he is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in london, and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. i have known something of him before.\" \"evidently,\" said i, \"mr. wilson\\'s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the red-headed league. i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.\" \"not him.\" \"what then?\" \"the knees of his trousers.\" \"and what did you see?\" \"what i expected to see.\" \"why did you beat the pavement?\" \"my dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. we are spies in an enemy\\'s country. we know something of saxe-coburg square. let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\" the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxe-coburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west. the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted. \"let me see,\" said holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, \"i should like just to remember the order of the houses here. it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london. there is mortimer\\'s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank, the vegetarian restaurant, and mcfarlane\\'s carriage-building depot. that carries us right on to the other block. and now, doctor, we\\'ve done our work, so it\\'s time we had some play. a sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\" my friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuth-hound, holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as i have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as i knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st. james\\'s hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down. \"you want to go home, no doubt, doctor,\" he remarked as we emerged. \"yes, it would be as well.\" \"and i have some business to do which will take some hours. this business at coburg square is serious.\" \"why serious?\" \"a considerable crime is in contemplation. i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. but to-day being saturday rather complicates matters. i shall want your help to-night.\" \"at what time?\" \"ten will be early enough.\" \"i shall be at baker street at ten.\" \"very well. and, i say, doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\" he waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd. i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours, but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes. here i had heard what he had heard, i had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the \"encyclopaedia\" down to the visit to saxe-coburg square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. what was this nocturnal expedition, and why should i go armed? where were we going, and what were we to do? i had the hint from holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker\\'s assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. i tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation. it was a quarter-past nine when i started from home and made my way across the park, and so through oxford street to baker street. two hansoms were standing at the door, and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above. on entering his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom i recognised as peter jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat. \"ha! our party is complete,\" said holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. \"watson, i think you know mr. jones, of scotland yard? let me introduce you to mr. merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night\\'s adventure.\" \"we\\'re hunting in couples again, doctor, you see,\" said jones in his consequential way. \"our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.\" \"i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\" observed mr. merryweather gloomily. \"you may place considerable confidence in mr. holmes, sir,\" said the police agent loftily. \"he has his own little methods, which are, if he won\\'t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. it is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.\" \"oh, if you say so, mr. jones, it is all right,\" said the stranger with deference. \"still, i confess that i miss my rubber. it is the first saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that i have not had my rubber.\" \"i think you will find,\" said sherlock holmes, \"that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. for you, mr. merryweather, the stake will be some £30,000; and for you, jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.\" \"john clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. he\\'s a young man, mr. merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london. he\\'s a remarkable man, is young john clay. his grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to eton and oxford. his brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. he\\'ll crack a crib in scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next. i\\'ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.\" \"i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. i\\'ve had one or two little turns also with mr. john clay, and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. it is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. if you two will take the first hansom, watson and i will follow in the second.\" sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into farrington street. \"we are close there now,\" my friend remarked. \"this fellow merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. i thought it as well to have jones with us also. he is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. he has one positive virtue. he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. here we are, and they are waiting for us.\" we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of mr. merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. this also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. mr. merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes. \"you are not very vulnerable from above,\" holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him. \"nor from below,\" said mr. merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. \"why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\" he remarked, looking up in surprise. \"i must really ask you to be a little more quiet!\" said holmes severely. \"you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\" the solemn mr. merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket. \"we have at least an hour before us,\" he remarked, \"for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. we are at present, doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks. mr. merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.\" \"it is our french gold,\" whispered the director. \"we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\" \"your french gold?\" \"yes. we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the bank of france. it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. the crate upon which i sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.\" \"which were very well justified,\" observed holmes. \"and now it is time that we arranged our little plans. i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. in the meantime mr. merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.\" \"and sit in the dark?\" \"i am afraid so. i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and i thought that, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your rubber after all. but i see that the enemy\\'s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. and, first of all, we must choose our positions. these are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. i shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. then, when i flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. if they fire, watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.\" i placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched. holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced. the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment\\'s notice. to me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault. \"they have but one retreat,\" whispered holmes. \"that is back through the house into saxe-coburg square. i hope that you have done what i asked you, jones?\" \"i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\" \"then we have stopped all the holes. and now we must be silent and wait.\" what a time it seemed! from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. my limbs were weary and stiff, for i feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but i could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor. suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light. at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. for a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones. its disappearance, however, was but momentary. with a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair. \"it\\'s all clear,\" he whispered. \"have you the chisel and the bags? great scott! jump, archie, jump, and i\\'ll swing for it!\" sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. the other dived down the hole, and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts. the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but holmes\\' hunting crop came down on the man\\'s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor. \"it\\'s no use, john clay,\" said holmes blandly. \"you have no chance at all.\" \"so i see,\" the other answered with the utmost coolness. \"i fancy that my pal is all right, though i see you have got his coat-tails.\" \"there are three men waiting for him at the door,\" said holmes. \"oh, indeed! you seem to have done the thing very completely. i must compliment you.\" \"and i you,\" holmes answered. \"your red-headed idea was very new and effective.\" \"you\\'ll see your pal again presently,\" said jones. \"he\\'s quicker at climbing down holes than i am. just hold out while i fix the derbies.\" \"i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,\" remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. \"you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins. have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say \\'sir\\' and \\'please.\\'\" \"all right,\" said jones with a stare and a snigger. \"well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the police-station?\" \"that is better,\" said john clay serenely. he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective. \"really, mr. holmes,\" said mr. merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, \"i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.\" \"i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr. john clay,\" said holmes. \"i have been at some small expense over this matter, which i shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the red-headed league.\" \"you see, watson,\" he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street, \"it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league, and the copying of the \\'encyclopaedia,\\' must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. it was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. the method was no doubt suggested to clay\\'s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice\\'s hair. the £4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? they put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.\" \"but how could you guess what the motive was?\" \"had there been women in the house, i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. that, however, was out of the question. the man\\'s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. it must, then, be something out of the house. what could it be? i thought of the assistant\\'s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. the cellar! there was the end of this tangled clue. then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london. he was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end. what could it be, once more? i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building. \"so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action. i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. i was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. it was not in front. then i rang the bell, and, as i hoped, the assistant answered it. we have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. i hardly looked at his face. his knees were what i wished to see. you must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. they spoke of those hours of burrowing. the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. i walked round the corner, saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friend\\'s premises, and felt that i had solved my problem. when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.\" \"and how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?\" i asked. \"well, when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr. jabez wilson\\'s presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. but it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. for all these reasons i expected them to come to-night.\" \"you reasoned it out beautifully,\" i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. \"it is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.\" \"it saved me from ennui,\" he answered, yawning. \"alas! i already feel it closing in upon me. my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. these little problems help me to do so.\" \"and you are a benefactor of the race,\" said i. he shrugged his shoulders. \"well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,\" he remarked. \"\\'l\\'homme c\\'est rien--l\\'oeuvre c\\'est tout,\\' as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand.\" ---------- this
